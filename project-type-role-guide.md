Great question.
If your platform is about **building, creating, and growing in public**, then your *project types* should describe **what kind of value is being created**, not just the industry. Below is a **comprehensive, modular taxonomy** you can directly use or adapt.

I’ll structure this in layers so it scales and stays flexible.

---

## 1. Core Project Types (Value-Oriented)

These are **top-level types** that most projects naturally fall into.

### 🧠 Knowledge & Thought

## 2. Project Stage (Orthogonal Tag, Very Important)

Instead of mixing stage into type, **tag it**:

* Idea / exploration
* Early experiment
* In progress
* Public testing
* Scaling
* Maintenance
* Archival / legacy

This is crucial for *expectation setting* when others engage.

---

## 3. Project Roles (Who Can Participate)

This is where your platform becomes powerful.

### Core Roles

* Initiator / Founder
* Co-creator
* Contributor
* Collaborator
* Researcher
* Designer
* Builder / Engineer
* Writer / Editor
* Performer / Artist

---

### Support Roles (Underrated but High-Value)

* Advisor / Mentor
* Critic / Reviewer
* Thought partner
* Listener / Witness
* Documentarian
* Community moderator
* Facilitator
* Curator

---

### Engagement Roles (Low Pressure, Scalable)

* Follower
* Supporter
* Participant
* Tester / User
* Audience
* Learner

---

### Resource Roles

* Funder / Sponsor
* Connector
* Recruiter
* Promoter
* Platform provider

---

## 4. A Key Design Insight (Very Important)

Instead of **forcing one project into one type**, allow:

> **1 Primary Type + Multiple Secondary Tags**

Example:

* Primary: *Arts & Culture → Film*
* Secondary: *Personal Growth, Social Impact, Community*

This reflects how real creative projects actually work.

---

## 5. Language Choice Matters (Small but Deep Insight)

Avoid overly corporate words unless necessary.

For example:

* “Initiative” → feels open and human
* “Startup” → feels outcome-driven
* “Practice” → feels process-driven
* “Experiment” → invites participation
* “Collective” → implies shared ownership

You might even let users **choose the word that frames their project identity**.

---

## 6. If You Want, Next Steps I Can Help With

* Design a **Project Type selector UI** (simple → advanced)
* Map **project types × roles** (who fits where)
* Define **“good participation” norms per project type**
* Design a **low-pressure engagement ladder**
* Help you decide which types to launch with first (PMF-oriented)

If you want, tell me:

> Are you optimizing for *deep collaboration*, *lightweight support*, or *long-term relationship building*?

That answer will refine this taxonomy even further.
